New Kali just runs the tools on virtal environment 

Just like docker the kali also instal external requirements on the virtual environment 


Use the following code if you Kali is not running the tools, after installing the dependences run the tool
└─# source venv/bin/activate 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
└─# pip install -r requirements.txt
